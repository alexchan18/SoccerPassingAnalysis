The English Premier League (EPL), based in England, is often regarded as the best soccer league in the world. It boasts some of the best players from around the world who have won the most prestigious competitions a player can win such as the UEFA Champions League, FIFA World Cup, and Copa America. 

Major League Soccer (MLS), based in the United States of America, is an up-and-coming league that is often criticized for being unentertaining and a ‘retirement home’ for Europe-based players past their best. Despite this, some players have been able to develop their skills and make the move to some of the top leagues in the world, including the EPL.

This research aims to explore the differences between the EPL and MLS with regards to a very basic skill in soccer: Passing. As the sport has progressed over the years, passing metrics have grown as an important measurement for how teams play. Analyzing these metrics can provide a deeper understanding of what differentiates the EPL and MLS in terms of quality.
